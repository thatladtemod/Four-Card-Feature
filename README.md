## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### What I learned

This project helped me understand how to combine CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts. I learned how to use `grid-template-areas` for complex layouts and how to center items both vertically and horizontally within a grid. I also practiced structuring a React project with reusable components.

**Example: Centering cards in a CSS Grid**
```css
.main-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "cyan red blue"
    ". orange .";
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 2rem;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: stretch;
  min-height: 500px;
}
.card {
  align-self: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my skills with advanced CSS Grid layouts and responsive design. I also want to focus more on accessibility and semantic HTML in future projects.
